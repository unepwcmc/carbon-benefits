## Local Shared Area
# These are the list of files and directories that you want
# to share between the releases of your application on a particular
# server. It uses the same shared area as the log files.
#
# NOTE: local areas trump global areas, allowing you to have some
# servers using local assets if required.
#
# So if you have an 'upload' directory in public, add 'public/upload'
# to the :local_shared_dirs array.
# If you want to share the database.yml add 'config/database.yml'
# to the :local_shared_files array.
#
# The shared area is prepared with 'deploy:setup' and all the shared
# items are symlinked in when the code is updated.
# set :local_shared_dirs, %w(public/upload)
# set :local_shared_files, %w(config/database.yml)
