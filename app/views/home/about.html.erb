      <h3>How to use the tool</h3>
      <p>Users can choose whether they wish to draw their own Areas of Interest (AOIs), select existing protected areas, or upload their own data. Estimates can also be calculated for mixtures of existing protected areas and self-drawn areas of interest, as well as for separate classes of or individual polygons from uploaded datasets.</p>
      <p><strong>To draw your own Area of Interest (AOI)</strong></p>
      <p>Activate the drawing by clicking on the respective button. Click on the map to mark an area for analysis. Finish by clicking again on your first point. The polygon will be added and the analysis run automatically.</p>
      <p><strong>To select individual Protected Areas</strong></p>
      <p>Select the Protected Areas layer from the basic layers dropdown menu and switch it on. A simple click on the protected area of interest will open a box with its name and a button to add it to the analysis, which will then run automatically.</p>
      <p><strong>To upload your own data</strong></p>
      <p>Click the upload button and follow the instructions from there. Formats supported are Shapefile, KML, CSV and GeoJSON. Shapefiles should be uploaded as a zipped archive.</p>
      <p><strong>Take a look at the video for viewing it in action!</strong></p>

              <p>Ecosystems store carbon (C) in their biomass, both above ground and in roots, and in the organic fraction of their soils. The density of the carbon in ecosystems varies with vegetation and soil types.</p>

              <p>Protected areas are defined as terrestrial or marine areas that are recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. This includes for example national parks and nature reserves.</p>

              <p>An ecological gap analysis is an assessment of the extent to which a protected area system meets protection goals set by a nation or region to represent its biological diversity. In many cases, the assessment yields spatial data identifying ‘gaps’ in the current protected area system, i.e. areas of importance for biodiversity conservation that are not yet officially recognised as protected areas. The Carbon Calculator includes spatial data from ecological gap analyses in Ecuador, Brazil and Mexico. </p>

              <p>This dataset differentiates between intact forest, fragmented/managed forest (where potential closed forest has been converted into open forest), partially deforested areas (where potential forest has been converted into woodland with low tree canopy density) and deforested areas (where potential forest cover of different density has been converted into non-forest). It was derived from a map of potential forest extent using existing ecoregion/ecozone classifications, climate data, and information on current forest distribution.</p>
              <p>This dataset was jointly produced by the World Resources Institute (WRI), the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on behalf of the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR)</p>

              <h6><a name="restoration_potential">RESTORATION OPPORTUNITIES</a></h6>
              <p>The restoration opportunities of degraded and deforested land depends on how densely it is populated, its degree of urbanization or industrialisation, and on whether it is cropland or not. Areas with high population density, or occupied by intensively managed croplands, were considered as having low/no restoration opportunities, while areas with scattered cropland areas, pastures, agroforestry and all types of forest plantations were considered as providing promising opportunities for restoration. Within the latter, the dataset differentiates between potential for a) wide-scale restoration (low population density and potential to support closed forest), b) mosaic restoration (moderate population density in a mosaic landscape with several functions), and c) remote restoration (population density less than one person per square kilometre within a 500km radius).</p>

              <p>The dataseton carbon sequestration potential provides an estimate of the maximum amount of carbon that could be sequestered through restoration on deforested and degraded lands, if all restoration opportunities was used, all activities were successfully implemented and sufficient time provided. The dataset has been derived by comparing current estimates of carbon stocks with estimates for maximum carbon stocks for forest types by ecofloristic zone. It is important to note that the actual gain in carbon is likely to be lower due to a number of influencing factors, such as the potential impact of climatic conditions, actual time available and the way measures are implemented, which are too complex and manifold to be considered in the assessment.</p>
