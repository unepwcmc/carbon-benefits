      <h4>MORE ABOUT THE TOOL</h4>
      <p>The <strong>Carbon Calculator</strong> is an innovative online tool that informs about the potential contribution of any selected area in the world to climate change mitigation by providing initial estimates on the amount of carbon currently stored inside, as well as the amount of additional carbon that could be sequestered through restoration. </p>
      <p>Moreover, it links this information with the conservation value and forest status of the area. </p>
      <p>The tool allows users to draw a line around their area(s) of interest (AOI) around any area in the world, or select any protected area, and provides them with the information on several areas.</p>
      <p class="orange">We advise cautious interpretation of results, as limitations apply to the underlying datasets. The tool is intended for educational and informational purposes only.</p>
